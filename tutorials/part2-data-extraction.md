## Python Code Organization

Before diving into data extraction, let's understand how Python code is typically organized.

### Python Files and Modules

- **Script (.py file)**: A standalone Python file that can be executed.
- **Module**: A Python file containing functions, classes, and variables that can be imported.
- **Package**: A directory containing multiple modules and a special `__init__.py` file.

### Basic Structure of a Python Script

```python
# 1. Import statements
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os

# 2. Constants and configuration
DATA_DIR = "data/"
OUTPUT_FILE = "results.csv"

# 3. Function definitions
def process_data(filename):
    # Function implementation
    pass

# 4. Main execution (often in a main function or under if __name__ == "__main__":)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Script execution starts here
    data = process_data(DATA_DIR + "input.csv")
    # More code...
